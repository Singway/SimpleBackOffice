    I've been learning ASP.Net Core for a while,trying to establish a Web program.
    So now,I create a simple model whit some fundamental functions.
    Establishing by NET Core + EF Core + HTML 5 + Bootstrap  + jQuery +NLog.
    
  ## Main Features:
    1.
    Provide dictionary tables for personalized configuration of department;
    2.
    Provide role, department, user, menu, foreground application authorization Role Authorization to Users
      Role Authorization to Departments
      Departments Authorize Users;
    3.
      Built-in Operation Log ,User Log on and Error Log;
    4.
      Fully responsive layout;
    5.
      Implement local and remote information validation.
      
  ## Database
    Support MSSQL/Oracle/SQLite....
    Ps: Using different database just need to edit the configuration of the connection.
    
    
    This program still needs a lot of improvement and I'll improve or refactor it gradually.
    Seriously,welcome to leave your opinion or suggestion here!
